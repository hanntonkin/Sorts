# Sorts
* Test implementation of selection, insertion, shell, quick, and merge sorts on c++ iterators
* Screwing around with R to produce a plot of input size and execution time

# Performance
* This is with a uniform random input of varying size
* Known improvements could be made for merge sort (removing temporary array allocation)
